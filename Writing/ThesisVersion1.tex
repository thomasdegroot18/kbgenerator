\section*{Abstract}
The development of larger knowledge based systems is growing rapidly. and the reasoners over these large datasets are following quickly behind. While reasoning over these large knowledge graphs is improving ++ADD IN CITATION++, it is mandatory that these knowledge systems are consistent. With one inconsistency the knowledge graph can break and it is no longer possible to reason of these graphs. Several methods exists that clean the knowledge bases from these inconsistencies. Other methods try to reason around the inconsistencies or use other methods to incorporate the knowledge in their reasoners. While most methods work well, the test cases that are used for these models are not a great representation of the complete world wide web of linked data. Most of the test cases are selected for their characteristics, or the datasets are specifically designed for the test purposes of the method.\\
To improve the general availability of inconsistent knowledge bases we designed an general knowledge base generator that uses generalized forms of inconsistencies found in the LOD-a-LOT ++ADD IN CITATION++ and use these inconsistencies to build an inconsistent knowledge base that is designed according to a set of parameters that can be given by the user.\\

\section{Approach \& Method}
This chapter will explain in detail how the implementation of the model has been done. Explaining how the inconsistencies were retrieved from the LOD-a-lot, and generalized. Then the chapter goes more in detail about how the generalized inconsistencies are used in the experiments. 

\subsection{Retrieval of the inconsistent subgraphs}
>Why are the subgraphs needed?
A reasoner is limited in the amount of data it can reason over within limited time. As more data means many different facts which will take more time to reason over. Even with optimizations it is not possible to reason over the LOD-a-lot without using massive amounts of CPU or taking a very long time. To improve the time needed to reason over we can either add more resources or make the amount of data to reason over smaller. The first option is not viable, but the second option is. 
It does however mean that we need to generate correct subgraphs without losing any of the inconsistencies that could be found only in the complete graph.

>So how are the subgraphs generated?
Generating the subgraphs without losing information is tricky as links are broken to retrieve a small part of the graph from a large graph. The goal is to minimize the loss by making sure that the severed links will be added in later stages of the pass through the complete graph.

To create a subgraph the algorithm loops through the entire graph and take a triple from this graph. From this triple the subject and >the object? are taken as root node. 


\subsection{Generalizing the subgraphs}
Why is generalization needed.


As the LOD-a-lot is immensily large it is not possible to reason over the complete cloud and find any inconsistencies, if there are any to be found. 


\begin{enumerate}
	\item Import the LOD-a-lot
	\item Retrieve a sub graph of the LOD cloud by choosing a vertex as root node and retrieving a small part of LOD-a-lot by expanding the root node.
	\item Check the sub graph for inconsistencies. 
	\item Retrieve the inconsistencies and check if they can be generalized.
	\item Generalize on basis of isomorphic, check if vertex isomorphic and edge isomorphic
	\item Add in ... steps to further generalize.
	\item Count the amount of occurrences per "generalized" inconsistent subgraph
	\item Make a generator that uses input from the generalized inconsistencies and user given parameters to build a knowledge base.
	\item The generator uses a .... ALGORITHM to build these graphs from the LOD-a-lot Cloud.
	\item The generator returns the graph to the user.
	\item Testing the generated graphs with the method to check if the consistencies are correct. 
	\item Implement several methods to test whether these methods perform as well as that the researchers propose.
	\item Show results.
