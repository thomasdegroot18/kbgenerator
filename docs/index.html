        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Based on formal semantics, most of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) on the Web of Data can be put to practical use.
          Unfortunately, a significant number of those KGs contain contradicting statements, and hence are logically inconsistent.</br>
          This makes reasoning limited and the knowledge formally useless. Understanding how these contradictions are formed,
          how often they occur, and how they vary between different KGs, is essential for fixing and avoiding such contradictions in the future,
          or are at least for developing better tools that handle inconsistent KGs. Methods exist to explain a single contradiction,
          by finding the minimal set of axioms sufficient to produce it, a process known as justification retrieval.</br>
          In large KGs, these justifications can be frequent and might redundantly refer to the same type of modelling mistake.
          Furthermore, these justifications are --by definition-- domain dependent, and hence difficult to interpret or compare.</br>
          This paper introduces the notion of anti-pattern for generalising these justifications, and presents an approach for
          detecting almost all anti-patterns from any inconsistent KG. Experiments on KGs of over 28 billion triples
          show the scalability of this approach, and the importance of anti-patterns to analyse and compare contradictions between KGs.
