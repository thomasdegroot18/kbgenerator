\section{Outline}
In chapter \ref{Background} the different concepts used in this work are introduced. Chapter \ref{RelatedWork} explains the related work, which has been done by others on which this work is based.
In Chapter \ref{Method} we explain more in detail how the method of `anti-pattern' retrieval works. Chapter \ref{InternalValidation} explains the experiments we performed to validate the internal proceedings of the algorithm. Chapter \ref{Implementation} showcases the possible applications that make extensive use from the `anti-pattern' that we retrieved in the method. In Chapter \ref{ExternalValidation} we show how the applications perform, we set in the introduction, and analyse the results. We conclude with a conclusion, with an extension of future work in chapter \ref{Conclusion}.
